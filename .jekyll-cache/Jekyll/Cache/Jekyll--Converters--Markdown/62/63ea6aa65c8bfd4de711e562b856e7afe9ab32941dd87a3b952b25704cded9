I"W<p>TripleWave is an open-source tool,  under Apache 2.0 license, to publish streams to the Web
It is a reusable and generic resource that enables the publication of <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/rsp/">RDF Streams</a> on the Web. It is independent of any specific engine implementation, and it can be fed with existing Web streams (e.g. Twitter and Wikipedia streams) or time-annotated RDF datasets (e.g. the Linked Sensor Data dataset). It can be invoked through both pull- and push-based mechanisms, thus enabling RSP engines to automatically register and receive data from TripleWave.</p>
