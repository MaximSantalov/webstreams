I"ï%<h2 id="sec:geldt">Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT)</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">GDELT</code> is the largest open-access spatio-temporal archive for human
society. Its Global Knowledge Graph spans more than 215 years and
connects people, organizations, locations, all over the world. GDELT
captures themes, images, and emotions into a single holistic global
network.</p>

<p>GDELT data comes from a multitude of news sources. The extraction
process follows techniques from Natural Language Processing and makes
use of two ontologies, i.e., Conflict and Mediation Event Observations
(CAMEO)¬†[@gerner2002conflict], and Global Content Analysis Measures
(GCAM). GDELT provisions multiple streams, in the following we discuss
three of them, i.e., Events, Mentions and Global Knowledge Graphs (GKG).
Consequently, GDELT information is naturally multidimensional and
interconnected due to the usage of complex background knowledge.</p>

<p>GDELT provisions streams of TSV data every 15 minutes. As anticipated,
it includes three streams, i.e., Events, Mentions, and Global 
Knowledge Graphs (GKG).</p>

<p>The <em>Event Stream</em> makes use of the dyadic CAMEO format. The
most important information regards the two actors participating in each
event, and the action they perform.</p>

<p>The <em>Mention Stream</em> records every
mention of an event over time, along with the timestamp the article was
published. The mention stream is linked to the Event stream by the
Global Event ID field.</p>

<p>The <em>GKG Stream</em> connects people, organizations,
locations, themes, news source, and event across the planet into a
single massive network. GKG stream is rich and multidimensional. Fields
like the GCAM, Themes, or Persons include more than one entry, using a
CSV or similar formats.</p>

<p>Several studies have been running using GDELT. In particular, data
visualization techniques that take into account the spatio-temporal
metadata of GDELT extracted events. GDELT offers different APIs to run
analysis and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Google Big Query</code><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> access to the database. GDELT
exposes examples of pre-configures analyses via the analysis service.
For instance, the Event <code class="highlighter-rouge">TimeMapper</code> visualizes events matching a given
search over time.</p>

<p>We collected all the information regarding the streams schemas into an
OWL 2 Ontology. Moreover, we started an knowledge engineering task that
involves both <code class="highlighter-rouge">CAMEO</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">GCAM</code><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">CAMEO</code> ontology is a coding scheme designed for the study of
third-party mediation in international disputes. It contains
hierarchical coding scheme for dealing with sub-state actors, event
types, and an extensive taxonomy for religious groups and ethnic groups.
For CAMEO, we focus on event types and actors, creating a comprehensive
hierarchy for the stream.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">GCAM</code> is a pipeline of 18 content analysis tools. Each news article
monitored by GDELT goes through GCAM pipeline that captures over 2230
dimensions, reporting density and value scores for each. Using GCAM, you
can assess the density of ‚Äú<em>Anxiety</em>‚Äù speech via Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC), or ‚Äú<em>Smugness</em>‚Äù via WordNet Affect. The GCAM Master
Codebook lists of all of the dimensions available<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. We converted the
Codebook in RDF and we refined it manually to link it to existing
vocabularies such as DBPedia and WordNET.</p>

<p>Listing¬†<a href="#lst:gdelt1">[lst:gdelt1]</a>{reference-type=‚Äùref‚Äù
reference=‚Äùlst:gdelt1‚Äù} shows a VoCaLS description for the GDELT Event
Stream. GDELT does not use a licence format, thus we include a licence
that is compliant with the terms of use. We also linked ontologies and
mappings using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdfs:seeAlso</code>. Since the stream is published regularly
as 15 minutes batch, we include metadata about the rate, i.e.,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">vocals:windowType</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">vocals:windowSize</code> at line 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of space, we do not include a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vocals:StreamEndpoint</code>
for the original source. However, since the complexity of the knowledge
engineering task is high, we are particularly interested in making the
mapping process transparent to collect feedback and improve data quality.</p>

<p>GDELT content is not natively RDF. Therefore, similarly to what we did
for WES, we need to set up a conversion mechanism. Similarly to what we
did for Wikimedia Event, Data conversion follows the RML approach, where
CSV data are converted using Mapping.</p>

<p>The following Listings¬†show a sample of the GDELT event mapping. We
used <code class="highlighter-rouge">rr:class</code> to assign the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gdelt:Event</code> type to the data at line 4.
Moreover, we also assign the CAMEO type using <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdf:type</code> at line 7. To
model the actors and its type hierarchy, we include a separate triple
map at line 12.</p>

<p>CARML allows us to extrapolate multidimensional entries of the GKG
stream like Themes or GCAM dimensions using custom functions. We develop
functions that can split the entry content and treat it accordingly.
Moreover, we enriched the Persons entry by retrieving relevant DBPedia
entities using DBPedia Spotlight and GeoNames APIs for locations.</p>

<p>We publish the GDELT stream using TripleWave approach. We shared the
VoCALS description files like the first Listing as S-GRAPH via REST APIs. Since the concept of event is first-class, we opted for a graph-based stream data model that maintains the granularity of information.</p>

<p>The following Listing presents an RSP-QL query that mixes all GDELT
streams. The query, which is inspired to an GDELT analyses available on
the GDELT blog, counts the number of mentions in events that are
happening in a particular area of IRAQ, and whose theme is <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcam:kill</code>.</p>
