# Explain how to convert to JSON-LD

Idea is reducing the conversion effort by creating a context

timestamp extraction has to be done in JSON


## things I noticed

- url should be used as @id
- collection have to be explained
- the GDELT ontology might need to include 
  also the container types to type the igraph
